.. class:: SearchByFeaturePanel(config)

A Panel to hold a spatial search by selecting features (via drawing) from another layer.

Search by Feature Selection works as follows:

 * select a source layer,
 * draw a geometry using a draw tool
 * observe features/geometries selected in the source layer
 * select a target layer (in which to search, using the geometries of features found in the source layer)
 * select a spatial operator for the search like WITHIN, or INTERSECTS
 * fire search through 'Search' button




Example Use
-----------

This Panel is mostly used in combination with the  `Heron.widgets.search.FeaturePanel <FeaturePanel.html>`_
in which results from a search are displayed in a grid and on the Map. Both Panels are usually bundled
in a `Heron.widgets.search.SearchCenterPanel <SearchCenterPanel.html>`_ that manages the search and result Panels.
See config example below.

.. code-block:: javascript

      {
      xtype: 'hr_searchcenterpanel',
      hropts: {
          searchPanel: {
          xtype: 'hr_searchbyfeaturepanel',
              id: 'hr-searchbyfeaturepanel',
              header: false,
              border: false,
              style: {
                  fontFamily: 'Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif',
                  fontSize: '12px'
              }
          },
          resultPanel: {
              xtype: 'hr_featuregridpanel',
              id: 'hr-featuregridpanel',
              header: false,
              border: false,
              autoConfig: true,
              exportFormats: ['XLS', 'WellKnownText'],
              hropts: {
                  zoomOnRowDoubleClick: true,
                  zoomOnFeatureSelect: false,
                  zoomLevelPointSelect: 8,
                  zoomToDataExtent: false
              }
          }
      }
      }


A ``SearchCenterPanel`` can be embedded in a Toolbar item popup as toolbar definition item ``searchcenter``
as below. ``Heron.examples.searchPanelConfig`` is the ``SearchCenterPanel`` config as above.

.. code-block:: javascript

  {
  type: "searchcenter",
  // Options for SearchPanel window
  options: {
       show: true,

      searchWindow: {
          title: __('Search by Drawing'),
          x: 100,
          y: undefined,
          width: 360,
          height: 400,
          items: [
              Heron.examples.searchPanelConfig
          ]
      }
  }
